# RickAndMorty
The idea is that you can report threats to the world to Rick and Morty, and after they accept the threat as real, it's added to the Threat List. I did this project early in my web development studies back in 2017. <br>
Check out the project live, hosted by Firebase: evilthreats.firebaseapp.com

## Project functionality
  * You can submit a new threat
  * You can log in to the Admin page with any username and password
  * As admin, you can Accept or Deny threats
  * If threat is accepted, the current Threat List will refresh with added threat
  * As admin, you can mark threat over and it will be removed from the list
